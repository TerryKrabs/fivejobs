5 Jobs

summary: I used react bootstrap, and routes too create a single page application that showcases 5 places I would like to work at after CodeStack. The UI is the bare minimum, but all requirements were met for the information

Peer Review: Bria Harrold
Nice I like the jobs you picked. The only thing is to add little padding and margin to your text so it doesn't bleed to the ends.
